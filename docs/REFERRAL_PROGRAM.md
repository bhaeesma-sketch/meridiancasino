   - Format: `USERNAME + 4 random alphanumeric characters`
   - Example: `CRYPTOKING99A1B2`

2. **New User Signs Up**
   - Uses referral link or enters code during signup
   - New user gets welcome bonus ($25 instead of $10)
   - Referrer gets instant signup bonus

3. **Ongoing Earnings**
   - Referrer earns commission on all referred user's wagering
   - Commissions are calculated in real-time
   - Earnings accumulate in referral balance

4. **Withdrawal**
